# Blocking System Implementation ✅🛡️

## 🎯 Feature Summary

Added a **tactical blocking mechanic** that allows both player and AI to reduce incoming damage by 50%. The system includes smart AI behavior that blocks strategically based on distance and attack patterns.

## 🎮 Player Controls

| Key      | Action   | Effect                                        |
| -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **E**    | Attack   | 15 damage (unblocked)                         |
| **F**    | Block    | Reduce incoming damage to 7.5 (50% reduction) |
| **WASD** | Movement | Disabled while blocking                       |

### **Blocking Mechanics:**

- **Hold F to block** - Continuous block while key is held
- **Can't move while blocking** - Trade mobility for defense
- **Block-cancel into attack** - Press E while blocking to instantly attack
- **Visual feedback** - Blue highlight + 🛡️ icon in UI when blocking

---

## 🤖 Smart AI Blocking

The AI uses **predictive blocking** based on player behavior:

### **Blocking Logic:**

```typescript
// AI checks if it should block based on:
// 1. Distance to player (< 2.5m)
// 2. Player's attack cooldown (ready to attack soon)
// 3. 30% random chance (prevents predictability)

const shouldConsiderBlocking = distance < 2.5 && playerFighterState.attackCooldown <= 0.3

if (shouldConsiderBlocking && rand < 0.3) {
  enemyFighter.blocking = true
}
```

### **AI Behavior:**

- ✅ Blocks when player is close + attack cooldown is low
- ✅ 30% chance = unpredictable but not spammy
- ✅ Resumes normal behavior when not blocking
- ✅ Can't attack while blocking (same rules as player)

## 📊 Combat Changes

### **Damage System:**

| Scenario          | Damage       | Knockback | Stun        | Animation         |
| ----------------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| **Unblocked Hit** | 15 HP        | 1.5m push | 0.2s freeze | `impact` → `idle` |
| **Blocked Hit**   | 7.5 HP (50%) | None      | None        | `impact` (brief)  |

### **Blocking Benefits:**

- **50% damage reduction** (15 → 7.5 HP)
- **No knockback** (stay in position)
- **No stun** (recover faster)

### **Blocking Drawbacks:**

- **Can't move** (vulnerable to positioning)
- **Can still take chip damage** (half damage through block)
- **Predictable if overused** (AI learns patterns)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **1. FighterComponent Update**

Added `blocking` field to track block state:

```typescript
export const FighterComponent = engine.defineComponent('fighter::component', {
  // ... existing fields
  blocking: Schemas.Boolean // Is currently blocking (reduces damage 50%)
})
```

**AnimationState Update:**

```typescript
export type AnimationState = 'idle' | 'run' | 'attack' | 'impact' | 'stun' | 'die' | 'block'
```

---

### **2. Player Blocking Input (systems.ts)**

**F Key Detection:**

```typescript
// Block input (F key = IA_ACTION_3)
const isBlocking = inputSystem.isPressed(InputAction.IA_ACTION_3)

if (isBlocking) {
  fighter.blocking = true
  if (fighter.currentAnimation !== 'block') {
    playAnimation(player, 'block')
  }
} else {
  fighter.blocking = false
}
```

**Movement Restriction:**

```typescript
// Can't move while blocking
if (!isBlocking) {
  if (inputSystem.isPressed(InputAction.IA_RIGHT)) moveX += 1
  if (inputSystem.isPressed(InputAction.IA_LEFT)) moveX -= 1
  // ... etc
}
```

**Block-Cancel into Attack:**

```typescript
// Can attack while blocking (cancels block)
if (inputSystem.isPressed(InputAction.IA_PRIMARY) && fighter.attackCooldown <= 0) {
  fighter.blocking = false // Cancel block
  performAttack(player)
}
```

---

### **3. Damage Reduction Logic (checkAttackHit)**

**Block Check on Hit:**

```typescript
if (distance < hitRange) {
  if (opponentFighter.blocking) {
    // Blocked! Reduce damage by 50%
    applyDamage(opponent, 7.5) // 15 * 0.5
    console.log(`🛡️ ${opponentFighter.isPlayer ? 'Player' : 'Enemy'} BLOCKED!`)

    // No knockback or stun on block
    playAnimation(opponent, 'impact', 300)
  } else {
    // Unblocked hit - full damage + knockback + stun
    applyDamage(opponent, 15)
    // ... knockback & stun logic
  }
}
```

---

### **4. Smart AI Blocking (enemyAISystem)**

**Predictive Blocking:**

```typescript
// Smart blocking logic
const playerFighterState = FighterComponent.getOrNull(player)
const shouldConsiderBlocking = distance < 2.5 && playerFighterState && playerFighterState.attackCooldown <= 0.3

// 30% chance to block when in danger zone
if (shouldConsiderBlocking && rand < 0.3) {
  enemyFighter.blocking = true
  if (enemyFighter.currentAnimation !== 'block') {
    playAnimation(enemy, 'block')
  }
} else {
  enemyFighter.blocking = false
}
```

**AI Behavior Priority:**

1. **Blocking** → If danger zone, 30% block
2. **Chasing** → If distance > 2.2m, run toward player
3. **Attacking** → If distance ≤ 2.2m, 2% attack chance
4. **Idle** → Otherwise, wait

---

### **5. UI Updates (ui.tsx)**

**Blocking Indicator:**

```typescript
// Player health bar
<Label
  value={`HP: ${p1Health}/${p1MaxHealth} | ${p1Anim.toUpperCase()}${
    playerFighter && playerFighter.blocking ? ' | 🛡️ BLOCKING' : ''
  }`}
  color={playerFighter && playerFighter.blocking ? Color4.create(0.3, 0.8, 1, 1) : Color4.White()}
/>
```

**Updated Controls:**

```
WASD - Move | E - Attack | F - Block
Block reduces damage by 50% | AI will block smart!
```

---

## 🎯 Gameplay Strategy

### **When to Block:**

- ✅ Player is winding up for attack (see attack cooldown low)
- ✅ In close range (< 2.5m)
- ✅ Low health (preserve HP with reduced damage)
- ✅ After attacking (defensive reset)

### **When NOT to Block:**

- ❌ Far from opponent (waste of mobility)
- ❌ Need to chase/reposition
- ❌ Opponent is blocking (both blocking = stalemate)
- ❌ Want to bait enemy attack then counter

### **Advanced Tactics:**

- **Block-cancel** - Block then immediately attack (fake defense)
- **Block-bait** - Block to make AI think you're defensive, then attack when they approach
- **Chip damage** - Even blocked hits do damage, so sustained pressure works

## 📊 Balance Tuning

| Parameter                  | Value   | Rationale                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Block Damage Reduction** | 50%     | Enough to be useful, not invincible         |
| **AI Block Chance**        | 30%     | Unpredictable but not spammy                |
| **Block Trigger Distance** | < 2.5m  | Slightly beyond attack range (2.5m vs 2.2m) |
| **Block Cooldown Check**   | <= 0.3s | Predicts imminent attack                    |

**Tuning Notes:**

- **30% AI block chance** = Blocks ~1 out of 3 attacks when in range
- **No knockback on block** = Encourages defensive play
- **Chip damage through block** = Prevents turtling/camping
- **Movement disabled** = Trade-off for defense

## 🎯 Summary

**Effort:** ~20 minutes  
**Impact:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 (Adds tactical depth)  
**Complexity:** Medium (AI logic + damage system integration)

The blocking system transforms combat from "spam attacks" to "read opponent → punish mistakes". The AI's predictive blocking creates mind games:

- **Player:** "Should I attack or bait their block?"
- **AI:** "Is the player about to attack?"

This is the **foundation for advanced fighting game mechanics** like:

- Guard breaks
- Mix-ups (high/low attacks)
- Frame traps
- Defensive options
